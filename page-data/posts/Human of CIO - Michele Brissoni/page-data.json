I met my second wife 10 years ago. She is from Slovakia but she has lived in Italy for more than two decades. She is more Italian than Slovak. </p>\n<p>I had several companies in Italy. I opened many startups. Later, I started to look at how IBM was doing Agile transformation and came across Jeff Smith and Phil Abernathy. I considered it a typical big bang corporate approach. I felt like that was the first wave of transformation. I came across the opening for an Agile Coach job with IBM and I applied. That was on Friday, and I got the call from the company on Monday. </p>\n<h2 id=\"interesting-can-you-throw-some-light-on-your-startup-journey\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#interesting-can-you-throw-some-light-on-your-startup-journey\" aria-label=\"interesting can you throw some light on your startup journey permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Interesting. Can you throw some light on your startup journey?</h2>\n<p>I started my first company at 18, a martial art gym, and my first startup in software development in the year 2000 after I came back from the army. I quit the army because I was injured on the battlefield. I have a Master’s degree in Telecommunications and Robotics. I hired a lot of guys from the university to do software in telecommunication. It was easy to work with people from the same culture who spoke the same language. There wasn’t much clash and we knew what to do. We grew immediately as a company. The idea was to build software for telecommunication. We built one of the first mobile Apps for Nokia usage at that time, an experimental version of Java Micro Edition and dedicated Nokia firmware. Later, it was acquired by Vodafone. </p>\n<h2 id=\"from-owning-multiple-companies-how-did-you-end-up-becoming-an-agile-coach\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#from-owning-multiple-companies-how-did-you-end-up-becoming-an-agile-coach\" aria-label=\"from owning multiple companies how did you end up becoming an agile coach permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>From owning multiple companies, how did you end up becoming an Agile Coach?</h2>\n<p>My brother is working in Formula 1 in Ferrari. It was roughly 2001 when they were looking for people to help them in IT. So, I worked with them as a consultant. I realized how differently their racing department worked. Then one day, I met a guy from Toyota, who also happened to be a Judo trainer as me. I learned the Toyota way, lean principles and discovered the true root of Agile.</p>\n<p>I led a lot of enterprise mission critical projects and worked in various sectors. I became CTO of multiple companies and worked with them for their enterprise and agile transformations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"id-like-to-go-back-to-what-you-said-earlier-about-the-military-how-was-the-transition-from-the-military-world-to-it\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#id-like-to-go-back-to-what-you-said-earlier-about-the-military-how-was-the-transition-from-the-military-world-to-it\" aria-label=\"id like to go back to what you said earlier about the military how was the transition from the military world to it permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>I’d like to go back to what you said earlier about the military. How was the transition from the military world to IT?</h2>\n<p>It was a drastic change. I went through years of therapy to understand how to behave in the “normal” world. When you have been in the army for several years you are completely detached from the “normal” world. And at that point, I understood the importance of coaching. I was coached to come back to normal life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-am-interested-to-know-what-kind-of-upbringing-you-had-that-took-you-towards-being-a-soldier\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#i-am-interested-to-know-what-kind-of-upbringing-you-had-that-took-you-towards-being-a-soldier\" aria-label=\"i am interested to know what kind of upbringing you had that took you towards being a soldier permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>I am interested to know what kind of upbringing you had that took you towards being a soldier.</h2>\n<p>I was a jackass. I used to beat everyone. I was doing everything illegal. I remember one particular incident from my kindergarten. I climbed the water pipe to go to the roof. I was 5 years old. For this reason, my grandfather, who was also a soldier, started to introduce me to Judo to learn discipline. Then, I never stopped.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/blogs/2020-02-28---Human-at-CIO/Mike.jpeg\" alt=\"Mike\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"did-you-have-a-chance-to-get-out-of-italy\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#did-you-have-a-chance-to-get-out-of-italy\" aria-label=\"did you have a chance to get out of italy permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Did you have a chance to get out of Italy?</h2>\n<p>I went to live in Berlin, Germany. With the army, I went everywhere. With martial arts, I went everywhere in the world. I hold six black belts in six different martial arts. I was in Thailand for the Thai box. I went to the US several times. I went to Asia for Judo and Jujutsu. And Latin America for the Brazil Jujutsu. I continue to train kids in martial arts. In Slovakia, I am struggling to perform martial arts. I will introduce my daughter to Judo next year.

What lesson did you learn from the army or martial arts or Judo?</h2>\n<p>From martial arts, I learned to be patient. I was like an animal. I did tons of fights in all the disciplines I practice, from Judo to free fight, from knife and sword to self defense in the warfield. Patience wasn’t my thing. I learned discipline and to never give up from cancer because I had two types of cancer. The first one was in 2010 and the second in thyroid in 2014. It taught me to be silent, not to complain or cry, and to never give up pushing myself beyond the impossible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-feel-like-its-a-bit-sensitive-topic-to-touch-do-you-want-to-talk-about-it-more\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#i-feel-like-its-a-bit-sensitive-topic-to-touch-do-you-want-to-talk-about-it-more\" aria-label=\"i feel like its a bit sensitive topic to touch do you want to talk about it more permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>I feel like it’s a bit sensitive topic to touch.

I do not believe in helping by providing money because you don’t know what they do with the money. In Italy, we have orphanages and “family houses” for cases when parents aren’t able to provide a healthy development environment for their kids, kids who are victims of drugs, alcohol, and violence. I trained those kids at the gym and taught them discipline to empower them. If you have shitty parents you become a shitty person. I helped these children to come out of the bad influence and many of them have surprised me by becoming awesome women and men.</p>\n<h2 id=\"do-you-like-slovakia\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#do-you-like-slovakia\" aria-label=\"do you like slovakia permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Do you like Slovakia?</h2>\n<p>Yes and no. It’s a good country. No, of course, it’s not Italy. It’s not my culture so I like and dislike. I like the lifestyle, security perception, quality of life. I don’t like the difference between the too rich and the too poor. There are a lot of homeless people. I don’t believe that is fair. Human relations are different, not so deep like what I’m used to. It’s a different taste.</p>\n<h2 id=\"you-have-a-wide-spectrum-of-experience-who-has-influenced-you-the-most-in-life\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#you-have-a-wide-spectrum-of-experience-who-has-influenced-you-the-most-in-life\" aria-label=\"you have a wide spectrum of experience who has influenced you the most in life permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>You have a wide spectrum of experience. Who has influenced you the most in life?</h2>\n<p>When I was young, I got the opportunity to meet Dalai Lama. I am a Buddhist. I didn’t have a good relationship with a catholic priest. I was catholic but I never accepted the show off such as drinking from a golden glass but pretending to be poor. A lot of the philosophy is not congruent with my belief. It’s a lie between what you see and what you do and I discovered that. My grandmother is a hardcore catholic. So I have a very good understanding of the church. I didn’t feel this life was correct for me. I’m a pragmatic, I do what I say. I came across a Buddhist, during my martial arts journey. I was fascinated and studied Buddhism in depth. I went to Thailand and Tibet and stayed with monks. This was a life-changing experience and from that point on, I don’t like the idea of possessing stuff. This helped me to restore my life after the military.</p>\n<h2 id=\"do-you-get-annoyed-what-annoys-you-most\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#do-you-get-annoyed-what-annoys-you-most\" aria-label=\"do you get annoyed what annoys you most permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Do you get annoyed? What annoys you most?</h2>\n<p>People (chuckles). I start to get annoyed by the relationship with people. When I see that people who are destroying themselves, and whining at the same time, but when you try to help them, they spit on you. They don’t understand what they are doing and they aren’t ready to be helped. I try to be as objective as I can. But, in general, I don’t get pissed off by anybody’s behavior. I let it go, everyone is the master of his/her fate.

If you like what you are doing and get comfortable, you will become dead soon. Maybe in a few months, life will eat you. I don’t believe in happiness. Happiness for me is waiting for an event to occur, it depends on external forces. I believe in enjoying what you do, and to enjoy you need to stretch.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/Human of CIO - Michele Brissoni","tagSlugs":["/tag/interview/","/tag/about-me/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-02-28T22:40:32.169Z","description":"A short interview I did in 2020 for the Human of CIO initiative","tags":["interview","about me"],"title":"Human of CIO - Michele Brissoni","socialImage":"/media/blogs/2020-02-28---Human-at-CIO/Mike.jpeg"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/Human of CIO - Michele Brissoni"}}}
