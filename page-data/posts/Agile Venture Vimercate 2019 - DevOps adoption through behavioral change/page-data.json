Would it be because I love them? This would be a typical joke in Italy regarding a famous lyric from the band ‘Ricchi e Poveri’… But after more than 16 years of the enterprise transformation journeys, I feel the duty to share my experience with the Italian community, and beyond, to clarify some misbelieves and some important failures and related lessons learned.”</em></p>\n<p>During the talk I explained what I implemented in IBM CIO, starting in 2017, to embrace Rugged DevOps and DesignOps/LeanUX on our most advanced development teams. A journey that wasn’t easy and that stomped on few antipatterns; wonderful opportunities to reshape a whole organization, like a blank canvas, starting from the bottom and using OKR to align it all.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/MicheleBrissoni/devops-adoption-through-behavioral-change\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Here</a> the slides on slideshare.
