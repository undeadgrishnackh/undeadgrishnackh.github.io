This dream sparked in me the need to stretch out of my comfort zone since the beginning. When normal kids were playing in the playground, I was practicing martial arts and racing. They told me, a real man has to fight, shoot, and drive faster than the grim reaper. This the mentality between the mountains, where surviving isn’t easy. A crazy spartan approach where kids were thrown into a modern Agoge of brutality and natural selection.</em></p>\n<p>But besides all this testosterone madness my parents helped me to accept to lose without never giving up. And so I did all my life, stretching my boundaries to the limits. And probably for this reason in life, love, and health, I touched spikes of drama and happiness able to write a plot for a new exciting Netflix series. </p>\n<p>I can proudly say that one thing was always constant in all my life, my passion for IT. So probably I’m one of the few geeks sport addicted.</p>\n<p>During the day a DevOps unicorn in jacket and tie focus to help organizations and individuals to transform themselves to achieve elite performance. After work, I’m a sports maniac addicted to speed and martial arts. I love doing Ju-Jitsu and Judo or quitting from the world riding my Ducatis, and last but not least, to close in myself doing cross-fit or hiking. </p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/Ferrari.jpg\" alt=\"dolomites\"><img src=\"/media/Hypermotard.jpg\" alt=\"dolomites\"><img src=\"/media/HypermotardTrip.jpg\" alt=\"dolomites\"><img src=\"/media/Judo.jpg\" alt=\"dolomites\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About me","date":null,"description":null,"socialImage":"/media/dolomites.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/about/"}}}
