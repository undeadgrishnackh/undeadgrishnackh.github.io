&lt;p&gt;I came to Slovakia in 2017 because I was tired of Italy. I met my second wife 10 years ago. She is from Slovakia but she has lived in Italy for more than two decades. She is more Italian than Slovak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had several companies in Italy. I opened many startups. Later, I started to look at how IBM was doing Agile transformation and came across Jeff Smith and Phil Abernathy. I considered it a typical big bang corporate approach. I felt like that was the first wave of transformation. I came across the opening for an Agile Coach job with IBM and I applied. That was on Friday, and I got the call from the company on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;

Can you throw some light on your startup journey?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my first company at 18, a martial art gym, and my first startup in software development in the year 2000 after I came back from the army. I quit the army because I was injured on the battlefield. I have a Master‚Äôs degree in Telecommunications and Robotics. I hired a lot of guys from the university to do software in telecommunication. It was easy to work with people from the same culture who spoke the same language. There wasn‚Äôt much clash and we knew what to do. We grew immediately as a company. The idea was to build software for telecommunication. We built one of the first mobile Apps for Nokia usage at that time, an experimental version of Java Micro Edition and dedicated Nokia firmware. Later, it was acquired by Vodafone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brother is working in Formula 1 in Ferrari. It was roughly 2001 when they were looking for people to help them in IT. So, I worked with them as a consultant. I realized how differently their racing department worked. Then one day, I met a guy from Toyota, who also happened to be a Judo trainer as me. I learned the Toyota way, lean principles and discovered the true root of Agile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I led a lot of enterprise mission critical projects and worked in various sectors. I became CTO of multiple companies and worked with them for their enterprise and agile transformations.&lt;/p&gt;

How was the transition from the military world to IT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a drastic change. I went through years of therapy to understand how to behave in the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù world. When you have been in the army for several years you are completely detached from the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù world. And at that point, I understood the importance of coaching. I was coached to come back to normal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a jackass. I used to beat everyone. I was doing everything illegal. I remember one particular incident from my kindergarten. I climbed the water pipe to go to the roof. I was 5 years old. For this reason, my grandfather, who was also a soldier, started to introduce me to Judo to learn discipline. Then, I never stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to live in Berlin, Germany. With the army, I went everywhere. With martial arts, I went everywhere in the world. I hold six black belts in six different martial arts. I was in Thailand for the Thai box. I went to the US several times. I went to Asia for Judo and Jujutsu. And Latin America for the Brazil Jujutsu. I continue to train kids in martial arts. In Slovakia, I am struggling to perform martial arts. I will introduce my daughter to Judo next year. I miss the energy to work with kids.&lt;/p&gt;

What lesson did you learn from the army or martial arts or Judo?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From martial arts, I learned to be patient. I was like an animal. I did tons of fights in all the disciplines I practice, from Judo to free fight, from knife and sword to self defense in the warfield. Patience wasn‚Äôt my thing. I learned discipline and to never give up from cancer because I had two types of cancer. The first one was in 2010 and the second in thyroid in 2014. It taught me to be silent, not to complain or cry, and to never give up pushing myself beyond the impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

Do you want to talk about it more?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My health died because of relentless sports. When I was in the war, we were exposed to this poisonous metal from a power plant. A lot of soldiers from my time got it, after all, we are the generation after Chernobyl. Also a lot of stress and other personal stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

How did cancer change your life?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer helped me to improve my life and you have to understand that what you face every day is nothing, tomorrow. After my first cancer, every day was a gift. You can never fight cancer. I am getting a checkup at least twice a year. It can reoccur anytime. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do lots of sports. Motorbike. I am a very disciplined guy. At the beginning, I trained because of martial arts and later to recover from my cancer. I wake up and do yoga. Then, I come to work. I go to the gym at lunchtime, back to work. I march with my ‚Äúsmall dog‚Äù 10km every single day whether it‚Äôs raining, snowing or anything. I try to spend time with my daughter as much as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, I don‚Äôt like people. I like animals more (laughs). I think people are selfish and for this reason, they can do everything that is not legal and harm others for their own benefit. The majority of people are like that. So, I like to find people who are different from these. Also, life can surprise you because someone is special. I like people who are transparent, direct and full of passion. Generally kids, especially kids with a tough life.&lt;/p&gt;

There must be something you are grateful for.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing good in this world. We have destroyed the planet. We kill each other for money. It‚Äôs a reality. I wasn‚Äôt pessimistic but I became one after what I saw on the battlefield. And my opinion gets stronger every day. The more money people have the more selfish, greedy, and arrogant they become. Money and power make people emotionally blind in every corner of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have done a lot of charity in Italy. I do not believe in helping by providing money because you don‚Äôt know what they do with the money. In Italy, we have orphanages and ‚Äúfamily houses‚Äù for cases when parents aren‚Äôt able to provide a healthy development environment for their kids, kids who are victims of drugs, alcohol, and violence. I trained those kids at the gym and taught them discipline to empower them. If you have shitty parents you become a shitty person. I helped these children to come out of the bad influence and many of them have surprised me by becoming awesome women and men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes and no. It‚Äôs a good country. No, of course, it‚Äôs not Italy. It‚Äôs not my culture so I like and dislike. I like the lifestyle, security perception, quality of life. I don‚Äôt like the difference between the too rich and the too poor. There are a lot of homeless people. I don‚Äôt believe that is fair. Human relations are different, not so deep like what I‚Äôm used to. It‚Äôs a different taste.&lt;/p&gt;

Who has influenced you the most in life?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was young, I got the opportunity to meet Dalai Lama. I am a Buddhist. I didn‚Äôt have a good relationship with a catholic priest. I was catholic but I never accepted the show off such as drinking from a golden glass but pretending to be poor. A lot of the philosophy is not congruent with my belief. It‚Äôs a lie between what you see and what you do and I discovered that. My grandmother is a hardcore catholic. So I have a very good understanding of the church. I didn‚Äôt feel this life was correct for me. I‚Äôm a pragmatic, I do what I say. I came across a Buddhist, during my martial arts journey. I was fascinated and studied Buddhism in depth. I went to Thailand and Tibet and stayed with monks. This was a life-changing experience and from that point on, I don‚Äôt like the idea of possessing stuff. This helped me to restore my life after the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People (chuckles). I start to get annoyed by the relationship with people. When I see that people who are destroying themselves, and whining at the same time, but when you try to help them, they spit on you. They don‚Äôt understand what they are doing and they aren‚Äôt ready to be helped. I try to be as objective as I can. But, in general, I don‚Äôt get pissed off by anybody‚Äôs behavior. I let it go, everyone is the master of his/her fate. Who am I to change it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to stretch your comfort zone. If you like what you are doing and get comfortable, you will become dead soon. Maybe in a few months, life will eat you. I don‚Äôt believe in happiness. Happiness for me is waiting for an event to occur, it depends on external forces. I believe in enjoying what you do, and to enjoy you need to stretch.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[IAD Milano 2020 - keyNote]]></title><description><![CDATA[Accelerate engineering agility everywhere - Cesare Baroni - Michele Brissoni]]></description><link>https://undeadgrishnackh.github.io//posts/Accelerate engineering agility everywhere - Cesare Baroni - Michele Brissoni</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://undeadgrishnackh.github.io//posts/Accelerate engineering agility everywhere - Cesare Baroni - Michele Brissoni</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2020 22:40:32 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;After the last conference, I got many requests to explain better the concepts behind ‚Äòthe Ecosystem‚Äô. To my surprise, Cesare Baroni, VP in IBM CIO, decided to do it with style. Hosting the Italian Agile Day Milano 2020 in our new venue, the IBM Studios, and sharing the keynotes with me. ü§© WOW, that Is a big deal and honor!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/blogs/2020-02-02---IAG-Milano/IBMStudiosMilano.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VENUE&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we started to write down the plot:
&lt;em&gt;‚ÄòSince the time the Agile Manifesto was published in 2001, we have seen the emerging of a variety of implementation frameworks, most of which have been extremely successful in small or mid-size organizations but consistently struggling to deliver sustainable results at large scale. In the last decade, the emerging of DevOps, i.e. the evolution of Agile applied to software engineering, started naturally selecting the most successful technical frameworks and integrating them into a widely acknowledged set of practices (continuous integration/continuous delivery, pervasive automation, extreme programming, shifting left security, microservices architecture, containerization, etc.). When we started with Agile at IBM CIO in 2015, we had to cope with a challenge no one has dealt with before: how can we adopt an agile working culture in an IT company operating in 170 countries and made by 380.000 employees? Dealing with the technical side of the work, isolated by the management and organizational dimensions, was just impossible. We had to find a way to address both aspects and support our teams on a journey that is still progressing today. The key success factor was to acknowledge that in a digital world, technical practices are not a secondary dimension compared to management, but they play a vital role to become an elite performance organization. We found confirmation of our intuition into the most recent DORA researches as well as in books like ‚ÄúAccelerate: the science of Lean Software and DevOps‚Äù (2018), written by the team who started the Phoenix project and is at the core of the DevOps movement. Well‚Ä¶ all this was very encouraging, but it didn‚Äôt help us so much to solve the core of our challenge: scale and complexity of a 110-year-old global corporation, where daily issues are by far greater than measuring the time ‚Äúfrom committing code to delivery‚Äù to ensure ‚ÄúDORA like‚Äù metrics are statistically accurate. We had to go beyond the available researches and proven frameworks. We had to start exploring how to expand our Agile operating model and dramatically improve product discovery, integrate design, embrace full user-centric product development, adopt Domain-Driven-Design with Event Storming, implement Communities of Practice and, last but not least, loosely couple our teams and architecture while keeping them tightly aligned. All this aiming to build a true ‚Äúopen organization‚Äù, i.e. ‚Äúan organization that engages participative communities both inside and out‚Äîresponds to opportunities more quickly,‚Ä¶ inspires, motivates, and empowers people at all levels to act with accountability‚Äù (Jim Whitehurst, The Open Organization: Igniting Passion and Performance, 2015). We plan to share our Agile journey at IBM CIO, what we have learned from our failure and successes, what are the questions we‚Äôre still trying to answer. We will also share how at IBM we are breaking new ground, applying transformative technical and leadership practices at the large global scale, not only to the latest and brightest emergency technologies but also to a hybrid IT portfolio that covers the whole history (and future) of software engineering: from legacy proprietary languages to Quantum, from private Mainframe datacenter to multi-tenant Cloud, from traditional relational databases to Blockchain, from legacy proprietary platforms to Open Source.‚Äô&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on a rainy day just before the COVID-19 pandemic emergency, and related Italian lockdown, we went on stage and &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/394383045&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt; the recording on Vimeo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019 I went there to have a speech about DevOps, SRE and SW craftsmanship to expert and students. I prepared something funny based on the main theme of the fest, the super hero. The allegory was which kind of developer are you? Deadpool the loliness jack ass, or Ironman, the super techy guy able to cooperate and sacrifice himself for the greatest of the team?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agileday.it/venture/2019/vimercate/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Agile venture Vimercate 2019&lt;/a&gt;, where the main topic was ‚ÄòDevOps answers the call for rapid innovation in fast-changing markets‚Äô. Which other places would be better to share my journey? None of course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/blogs/2019-06-12---DevOps-Vimercate/IAM_Venture_Vimercate.png&quot; alt=&quot;AVV&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I prepared a funny speech cover: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúDevOps, Agile, eXtreme Programming, LeanUX, Site Reliability Engineer, DevSecOps‚Ä¶ what a mess! Would it be because I love them? This would be a typical joke in Italy regarding a famous lyric from the band ‚ÄòRicchi e Poveri‚Äô‚Ä¶ But after more than 16 years of the enterprise transformation journeys, I feel the duty to share my experience with the Italian community, and beyond, to clarify some misbelieves and some important failures and related lessons learned.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the talk I explained what I implemented in IBM CIO, starting in 2017, to embrace Rugged DevOps and DesignOps/LeanUX on our most advanced development teams. A journey that wasn‚Äôt easy and that stomped on few antipatterns; wonderful opportunities to reshape a whole organization, like a blank canvas, starting from the bottom and using OKR to align it all.&lt;/p&gt;
