As an Agile and DevOps coach, I got multiple times questions related to my portfolio. My lovely grandma provided me a life lesson that is always suspicious when someone talks about something without being able to show it. For a long time I was wondering about how to being able to show my portfolio, even with all NDA I signed in my career. This was a big limit that prevented me to publish the details related to the projects I’ve worked on. But one day... 
I was performing a coding interview. I was in front of a very nervous candidate. When I asked him to solve a TicTacToe kata in the upcoming 24 hours, he was near to faint. In this precise moment, I finally found how to show my portfolio. It is funny how this idea was in front of me for so many years! 
For this reason, my portfolio here is a katas collection, kinda essays, to show my style in the software craftsmanship and in how I approach others to experience Extreme Programming. In these katas, I'm trying also to let emerging the foundation I've in Agile, eXtreme Programming, DevOps, RuggedDevOps, and LeanUX.

My first part of the portfolio is a self-reminder to never lose the focus on improvement. For this reason, I try to solve kata on a daily base. Every time with new boundaries and/or handicaps. My source of inspiration is CodeWars. In my humble opinion, it's a great platform where to start to code. It's also a good place to stretching ourselves outside the concept of 'I develop in XXXX'. The future of DevOps & SRE is to try to achieve the polyglottism. The is to incrementally become the guy that can say for instance: 'I am a polyglot, coding mainly in Java but with a good prophecy also on JS, Python, Ruby, Go, etc...'

A different story instead is my GitHub repository. Here I typically store the katas that are relevant for the eXtreme Programming classroom, mentoring, or coaching I do with teams and individuals.

## Hiring Kata: the TicTacToe 😱 _nightmare_ 👻
This kata is one of my preferred. It's a very easy problem to solve but with a lot of fun and gamification boost. In the end, everyone all around the world played it in childhood! I love this kata because it is possible to create with it a full E2E product package. From the LeanUX discovery to a full RuggedDevOps pipeline over a solid 95%+ test coverage application. For this reason, I love it as hiring kata, and from time to time I try to understand what is possible to achieve in 24 hours. So here some of my experiments to understand how much a candidate can push on a fully open-source product.

| Repository  | Description |
|---|---|
| [![JAVA](/media/portfolio/java.png)](https://github.com/undeadgrishnackh/tictactoe) | Java version that covers: Trello Backlog, TDD development, CI/CD, quality gates, and behavioral code analysis.  |
|  |  |
| [![JS](/media/portfolio/javascript.png)](https://github.com/undeadgrishnackh/tictactoe_js) | An old JS version that I use as starting seed lesson for the Rugged DevOps concepts. |

## The Jumpstarter: XP foundations - 🍅⏲️ + 🗒️ + 🧑‍💻🧑🏿‍💻
The Mumbling API kata is one of my preferred 'jump-starts'. An Inside-Out approach to start to practice about the XP foundations!

| Repository  | Description |
|---|---|
| [![JS](/media/portfolio/javascript.png)](https://github.com/undeadgrishnackh/Mumbling) | It's a very simple algorithm that let people to focus on: |
| | - pomodoro technique & how to write good notes |
| | - pair programming in 25mins timebox |
| | - emerging architecture inside-out (algorith, API, API dictionary) |
| | - creating BDD E2E UAT |

## Refactoring Etiquette: do it right in pair and mob. Avoid wars ⚔️ 💣 ☠️
One of the biggest dysfunction I find very often in dev teams is the lack of social respect and empathy when it's time to criticize the code. This very hidden social behavior emerges pRepositorytentely all the time a team or a pair is doing Refactory or Code Review. How many times we were into a 'this is my code mood'? How many times this translated into a touchy mood or even worst? 

| Repository  | Description |
|---|---|
| [![JS](/media/portfolio/javascript.png)](https://github.com/undeadgrishnackh/CarParkEscape) | For this reason I love this kata because it starts to have the right complexity to review the code and start the discussion about "review etiquette" with a sparkle of neuroscience and theatre plot. What happens in this "dysfunctional" situation if ... This the way I love to create team awareness about the importance of social contracts.|
| | - User Story, Definiton of Ready |
| | - Technical Social contract |
| | - Code Review Etiquette ([a good example](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review)) |

## Double-loop approach - BDD 🔁 + TDD 🔁 
| Repository  | Description |
|---|---|
| [![JS](/media/portfolio/javascript.png)](https://github.com/undeadgrishnackh/MathPortal) | After having understood the importance of the social dysfunction on a team, I love to take people hand-by-hand in the double loop practice.|
| | BDD and TDD in a user-centric approach where the E2E scenario is the product drivers |


## 🎮 Conway's Game of Life 👾👾
| Repository  | Description |
|---|---|
| [![JS](/media/portfolio/javascript.png)](https://github.com/undeadgrishnackh/Conway-s_Game_of_Life) | One of my preferred game on CodeWars where to start to use the Outside-In approach with the double loop to decoupling complexity. |

## 🎮 The Minesweeper ⛏️ and 💣
| Repository  | Description |
|---|---|
| [![JS](/media/portfolio/javascript.png)](https://github.com/undeadgrishnackh/minesweeper) | I love doing kata with the gamification boost. The minesweeper is something that fits perfectly with this purpose. It's complex enough to trigger all the good foundational practices. But at the same time can be extended to something more complex as architectural demanding of game storage or with a multi player. |


## ⏰ Berlin Clock 💡💡💡💡💡💡💡💡💡
| Repository  | Description |
|---|---|
| [![JS](/media/portfolio/javascript.png)](https://github.com/undeadgrishnackh/BerlinClock) | One of my preferred data structure kata that helps the team to focus as users on an incremental problem complexity approach based on the double loop BDD and TDD| 
| [![GoogleDoc](/media/portfolio/googleDoc.png)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Mh0Tmrf5hZ7EE7cDF0q9Pqr-4i5x4bs_3K3jdR2eA8) | Here one of my attempt to solve the kata on a google doc. It was fun! |

# SRE Challenge 🤯 - code on a google doc 🍭
Doing researches on talent hunting and unicorns I found a profound inspiration from the Google way. It could be because I love their innovation approach, or because I'm addicted to their researches, but in any case, when I saw the coding interview I was speechless. So I started to switch my kata from a pure sandbox in a fully customized IDE full of tricks and snippets where almost everything is automated, to an empty google doc. If you wanna enjoy it, take a look at my [google docs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vrL2ET-i8UiEFGr81yHPV4AoI9nA308F?usp=sharing).
