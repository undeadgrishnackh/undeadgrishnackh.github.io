#### Awards 🏆
One special **award** I'm really proud of is the prestigious **IBM CIO Challenge coin** that I got in the last 2019 all-hands with the following motivations:
1. to have introduced the **OKR technique** enhancing mission alignment and clarity of purpose across the company;
2. to have developed and successfully deployed **"The - Ecosystem"** across the company, as an enterprise transformation platform that strengthens teams towards the DORA elite performance level.
