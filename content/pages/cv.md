#### Classic multiple pages format 📖
**[The second](/media/cv/Resume_MicheleBrissoni.pdf)** instead is a _classic_ CV with more details and content where I added in the last page a 'My working journey in a nutshell' section that will help you to understand my professional journey.

#### Certifications, Badges and awards 🏆
[Here](https://www.youracclaim.com/users/michele-brissoni/badges) some badges I collected anlog the IBM journey. For the complete certifications list, take a look at [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelebrissoni/) profile section _Licenses and Certifications_.

One special award I'm really proud of is the prestigious **IBM CIO Challenge coin** that I got it in the last 2019 all-hands with the following motivations:
1. to have introduced the **OKR technique** enhancing mission alignment and clarity of purpose across the company;
2. to have developed and successfully deployed **"The - Ecosystem"** across the company, as an enterprise transformation platform that strengthens teams towards the DORA elite performance level.
