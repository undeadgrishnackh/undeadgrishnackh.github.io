I'm a mountain man born in the north of Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ and this was the horizon I saw for years with always the idea that one day I'd be able to go beyond these pikes were surrounding me.

*Perhaps it is for this reason that I love so much to travel and to meet new people. This dream sparked in me the need to stretch out of my comfort zone since the beginning. When normal kids were playing in the playground, I was practicing martial arts and racing. They told me, a real man has to fight, shoot, and drive faster than the grim reaper. This the mentality between the mountains, where surviving isn't easy. A crazy spartan approach where kids were thrown into a modern Agoge of brutality and natural selection.*

But besides all this testosterone madness my parents helped me to accept to lose without never giving up. And so I did all my life, stretching my boundaries to the limits. And probably for this reason in life, love, and health, I touched spikes of drama and happiness able to write a plot for a new exciting Netflix series.

I can proudly say that one thing was always constant in all my life, my passion for IT. So probably I'm one of the few geeks sport addicted. During the day a DevOps unicorn in jacket and tie focus to help organizations and individuals to transform themselves to achieve elite performance.

After work, I'm a sports maniac addicted to speed and martial arts. I love doing Ju-Jitsu and Judo or quitting from the world riding my Ducatis, and last but not least, to close in myself doing cross-fit or hiking. 

If you wanna know even more about me, take a read of [THIS](/posts/Human%20of%20CIO%20-%20Michele%20Brissoni) interview I did for the IBM CIO Magazine.
