"What you face every single day is nothing tomorrow." - Michele Brissoni

## When and how did you end up in Slovakia?
I came to Slovakia in 2017 because I was tired of Italy. I met my second wife 10 years ago. She is from Slovakia but she has lived in Italy for more than two decades. She is more Italian than Slovak. 

I had several companies in Italy. I opened many startups. Later, I started to look at how IBM was doing Agile transformation and came across Jeff Smith and Phil Abernathy. I considered it a typical big bang corporate approach. I felt like that was the first wave of transformation. I came across the opening for an Agile Coach job with IBM and I applied. That was on Friday, and I got the call from the company on Monday. 

## Interesting. Can you throw some light on your startup journey?
I started my first company at 18, a martial art gym, and my first startup in software development in the year 2000 after I came back from the army. I quit the army because I was injured on the battlefield. I have a Master's degree in Telecommunications and Robotics. I hired a lot of guys from the university to do software in telecommunication. It was easy to work with people from the same culture who spoke the same language. There wasn't much clash and we knew what to do. We grew immediately as a company. The idea was to build software for telecommunication. We built one of the first mobile Apps for Nokia usage at that time, an experimental version of Java Micro Edition and dedicated Nokia firmware. Later, it was acquired by Vodafone. 

## From owning multiple companies, how did you end up becoming an Agile Coach?
My brother is working in Formula 1 in Ferrari. It was roughly 2001 when they were looking for people to help them in IT. So, I worked with them as a consultant. I realized how differently their racing department worked. Then one day, I met a guy from Toyota, who also happened to be a Judo trainer as me. I learned the Toyota way, lean principles and discovered the true root of Agile.

I led a lot of enterprise mission critical projects and worked in various sectors. I became CTO of multiple companies and worked with them for their enterprise and agile transformations.

## I'd like to go back to what you said earlier about the military. How was the transition from the military world to IT?
It was a drastic change. I went through years of therapy to understand how to behave in the "normal" world. When you have been in the army for several years you are completely detached from the "normal" world. And at that point, I understood the importance of coaching. I was coached to come back to normal life.

## I am interested to know what kind of upbringing you had that took you towards being a soldier.
I was a jackass. I used to beat everyone. I was doing everything illegal. I remember one particular incident from my kindergarten. I climbed the water pipe to go to the roof. I was 5 years old. For this reason, my grandfather, who was also a soldier, started to introduce me to Judo to learn discipline. Then, I never stopped.

## Did you have a chance to get out of Italy?
I went to live in Berlin, Germany. With the army, I went everywhere. With martial arts, I went everywhere in the world. I hold six black belts in six different martial arts. I was in Thailand for the Thai box. I went to the US several times. I went to Asia for Judo and Jujutsu. And Latin America for the Brazil Jujutsu. I continue to train kids in martial arts. In Slovakia, I am struggling to perform martial arts. I will introduce my daughter to Judo next year. I miss the energy to work with kids.

## I am baffled, to be honest. What lesson did you learn from the army or martial arts or Judo?
From martial arts, I learned to be patient. I was like an animal. I did tons of fights in all the disciplines I practice, from Judo to free fight, from knife and sword to self defense in the warfield. Patience wasn't my thing. I learned discipline and to never give up from cancer because I had two types of cancer. The first one was in 2010 and the second in thyroid in 2014. It taught me to be silent, not to complain or cry, and to never give up pushing myself beyond the impossible.

## I feel like it's a bit sensitive topic to touch. Do you want to talk about it more?
My health died because of relentless sports. When I was in the war, we were exposed to this poisonous metal from a power plant. A lot of soldiers from my time got it, after all, we are the generation after Chernobyl. Also a lot of stress and other personal stuff.

## I feel extremely small in front of you right now. How did cancer change your life?
Cancer helped me to improve my life and you have to understand that what you face every day is nothing, tomorrow. After my first cancer, every day was a gift. You can never fight cancer. I am getting a checkup at least twice a year. It can reoccur anytime. 

## How do you spend your free time?
I do lots of sports. Motorbike. I am a very disciplined guy. At the beginning, I trained because of martial arts and later to recover from my cancer. I wake up and do yoga. Then, I come to work. I go to the gym at lunchtime, back to work. I march with my "small dog" 10km every single day whether it's raining, snowing or anything. I try to spend time with my daughter as much as I can.

## What do you like about people?
First of all, I don't like people. I like animals more (laughs). I think people are selfish and for this reason, they can do everything that is not legal and harm others for their own benefit. The majority of people are like that. So, I like to find people who are different from these. Also, life can surprise you because someone is special. I like people who are transparent, direct and full of passion. Generally kids, especially kids with a tough life.

## Do you think being in the army has made you more pessimistic? There must be something you are grateful for.
There is nothing good in this world. We have destroyed the planet. We kill each other for money. It's a reality. I wasn't pessimistic but I became one after what I saw on the battlefield. And my opinion gets stronger every day. The more money people have the more selfish, greedy, and arrogant they become. Money and power make people emotionally blind in every corner of the world.

## Have you done any charity?
I have done a lot of charity in Italy. I do not believe in helping by providing money because you don't know what they do with the money. In Italy, we have orphanages and "family houses" for cases when parents aren't able to provide a healthy development environment for their kids, kids who are victims of drugs, alcohol, and violence. I trained those kids at the gym and taught them discipline to empower them. If you have shitty parents you become a shitty person. I helped these children to come out of the bad influence and many of them have surprised me by becoming awesome women and men.

## Do you like Slovakia?
Yes and no. It's a good country. No, of course, it's not Italy. It's not my culture so I like and dislike. I like the lifestyle, security perception, quality of life. I don't like the difference between the too rich and the too poor. There are a lot of homeless people. I don't believe that is fair. Human relations are different, not so deep like what I'm used to. It's a different taste.

## You have a wide spectrum of experience. Who has influenced you the most in life?
When I was young, I got the opportunity to meet Dalai Lama. I am a Buddhist. I didn't have a good relationship with a catholic priest. I was catholic but I never accepted the show off such as drinking from a golden glass but pretending to be poor. A lot of the philosophy is not congruent with my belief. It's a lie between what you see and what you do and I discovered that. My grandmother is a hardcore catholic. So I have a very good understanding of the church. I didn't feel this life was correct for me. I'm a pragmatic, I do what I say. I came across a Buddhist, during my martial arts journey. I was fascinated and studied Buddhism in depth. I went to Thailand and Tibet and stayed with monks. This was a life-changing experience and from that point on, I don't like the idea of possessing stuff. This helped me to restore my life after the military.

## Do you get annoyed? What annoys you most?
People (chuckles). I start to get annoyed by the relationship with people. When I see that people who are destroying themselves, and whining at the same time, but when you try to help them, they spit on you. They don't understand what they are doing and they aren't ready to be helped. I try to be as objective as I can. But, in general, I don't get pissed off by anybody's behavior. I let it go, everyone is the master of his/her fate. Who am I to change it?

## Any life advice you would like to give to ordinary people like us (laugh)?
You have to stretch your comfort zone. If you like what you are doing and get comfortable, you will become dead soon. Maybe in a few months, life will eat you. I don't believe in happiness. Happiness for me is waiting for an event to occur, it depends on external forces. I believe in enjoying what you do, and to enjoy you need to stretch.
