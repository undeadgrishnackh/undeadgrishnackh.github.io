In my transformation executive career, I got very often questions like: 
> "How may I transform my company?". 

For a long time, I tried to reply to my interlocutors, but normally after a few seconds, I was feeling my receiver wasn't prepared (or combat-ready) to listen to what I was telling. I guess is the typical effect of the adoption curve. Only an early adopter can be in sync to listen to something is still an emerging, or even worst, a pioneering approach. But now the __'community of practice'__ is a well-known concept. *The spark to trigger an enterprise IT transformations*. 
A big thank has to be provided to the **Accelerate** book and related **DORA researches**. They raised the global awareness necessary to being understood by almost everyone about the content of my new blog.

Stay tuned because in the upcoming post I’ll cover the neuroscience training approach I use in the XPFarm to empower people to change their way of doing in a non-invasive and non-violent way. An evolution of 'Training from the BACK of the room' I refined in with professional athletes, army, and several IT companies.
