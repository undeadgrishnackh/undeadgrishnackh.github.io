Was June 2019 when I finally decided to share in a conference with the Italian community my 16 years of experimentation on enterprise transformation on IT companies.

The place, the [Agile venture Vimercate 2019](https://www.agileday.it/venture/2019/vimercate/), where the main topic was 'DevOps answers the call for rapid innovation in fast-changing markets'. Which other places would be better to share my journey? None of course!

So I prepared a funny speech cover: 

_"DevOps, Agile, eXtreme Programming, LeanUX, Site Reliability Engineer, DevSecOps... what a mess! Would it be because I love them? This would be a typical joke in Italy regarding a famous lyric from the band 'Ricchi e Poveri'... But after more than 16 years of the enterprise transformation journeys, I feel the duty to share my experience with the Italian community, and beyond, to clarify some misbelieves and some important failures and related lessons learned."_

During the talk I explained what I implemented in IBM CIO, starting in 2017, to embrace Rugged DevOps and DesignOps/LeanUX on our most advanced development teams. A journey that wasn't easy and that stomped on few antipatterns; wonderful opportunities to reshape a whole organization, like a blank canvas, starting from the bottom and using OKR to align it all.
