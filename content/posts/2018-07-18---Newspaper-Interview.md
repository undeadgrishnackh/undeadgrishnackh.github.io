When you're in a foreign country, sometimes, your being strange is a catalyst... and if the observers are journalists, then everything can happen.

So one day two journalists asked me if I'd like to have an interview to understand why I relocated in Slovakia. 

[HERE](https://www.postoj.sk/34949/taliani-na-slovensku-preco-je-nam-u-vas-lepsie) the result... in slovak ðŸ¤£ ... Google translator will help you to understand it in whatever language you like ðŸ˜œ


## My personal takeaway living abroad... 
_'Stretch yourself, live in a melting-pot environment, and be open. With bias, you'll get back only hate.'_
