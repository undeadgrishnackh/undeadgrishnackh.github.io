IBM Fest is a tradition in Bratislava. An yearly event that runs for few days where new experts, talents and students meet all together in one wonderful venuee in the [old town](https://staratrznica.sk/?_locale=en).
 
In 2019 I went there to have a speech about DevOps, SRE and SW craftsmanship to expert and students. I prepared something funny based on the main theme of the fest, the super hero. The allegory was which kind of developer are you? Deadpool the loliness jack ass, or Ironman, the super techy guy able to cooperate and sacrifice himself for the greatest of the team?
